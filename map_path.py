    This is a 2D map.   Stations(Work stations and Battery charge station) are sit on.
    Will help to find a path from Station-A to Station-B
        1. Points Can be identified by RFid reader. or QR-code reader.
        2. Track might be spilited in from of a Point.
    For Version 1.0, We consider the simplest path
        1. The track is a ring, only one branch.
        2A. Follow left branch, will move to next work station.
        2B. Follow right branch, will move to Battery Charge station.
